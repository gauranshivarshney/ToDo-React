# Todo App

A simple React-based Todo application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The app includes features for adding, completing, editing, and deleting tasks, with persistent storage using localStorage.

## Features

- Add Tasks: Users can create new tasks by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- Complete Tasks: Tasks can be marked as complete by selecting a checkbox. Completed tasks are visually distinct with a line-through style.
- Edit Tasks: Editable tasks allow users to update their content. Tasks cannot be edited if they are marked as completed.
- Delete Tasks: Tasks can be removed entirely from the list by clicking the delete button.
- Local Storage Persistence: Tasks are saved to the browser's localStorage, ensuring that the list persists even after a page refresh.
